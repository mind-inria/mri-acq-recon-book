# MRI Acquisition and Reconstruction tutorials 


This repository contains code and slides that were initially presented at ISBI'19 in Venice during the tutorial entitled: "Recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction for Compressed Sensing MRI". The code focuses on basics and recent advances in MR acquisition or design of k-space sampling schemes. Then the code has been progressively extended for the 2022 IEEE Biomedical Imaging summer school that held in St Jacut de la Mer in June 2022 and then it has incorporated demos on deep learning for the the 2023 ISBI Tutorial titled "Computational MRI in the Deep Learning Era: The two facets of acquisition and image reconstruction" in Cartagena de Indias (Columbia). Even more recently, in 2024, I started to use MRI-NUFFT to illustrate multiple 2D and 3D non-Cartesian trajectories with density compensated adjoint Non-Unform Fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) reconstruction. Some aspects related to MRI reconstruction in the ISBI'19 tutorial were taught by [Prof. Jeff Fessler](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl) with code and examples in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language.
